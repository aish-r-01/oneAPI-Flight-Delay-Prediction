# oneAPI-Flight-Delay-Prediction


## A Two stage Flight Delay Prediction

This project focuses on the development of a robust two-stage machine learning model for precise flight delay prediction. It unfolds in two pivotal stages: Classification and Regression. In the initial classification stage, we leverage a suite of classification algorithms to categorize flights into two distinct classes, namely â€™Delayedâ€™ or â€™Not Delayedâ€™. These classifiers are meticulously evaluated using performance metrics to ensure their accuracy and effectiveness. In the subsequent regression stage, regression algorithms are utilised in generating highly accurate forecasts for arrival delays, quantified in minutes. The evaluation of regressors was performed, involving an in-depth analysis of metrics to identify the top-performing model. Through this rigorous comparison of various models, we identify and select the best performing classifier and regressor models based on their ability to meet the accuracy and precision criteria.

## Intel oneAPI's sklearnex
This project showcases the integration of cutting-edge technology to enhance the performance and efficiency of our two-stage machine learning model for precise flight delay prediction. In addition to our robust classification and regression stages, we've further optimized our project by incorporating Intel's One API, a powerful suite of tools and libraries designed to boost performance and accelerate computations.

The integration of Intel's One API, particularly its optimized version of scikit-learn (sklearnex), has yielded remarkable results. By harnessing the power of Intel's optimized machine learning libraries, we observed a significant reduction in runtime, enhancing the overall speed and efficiency of our flight delay prediction system.

This project not only excels in its core objective of precise flight delay prediction but also stands as a testament to the transformative impact of Intel's One API and its optimized machine learning libraries. By combining our two-stage machine learning model with Intel's technology, we've elevated the speed and efficiency of our system, offering a comprehensive and powerful solution for flight delay prediction. ðŸš€
