## A Two stage Flight Delay Prediction

This project focuses on the development of a robust two-stage machine learning model for precise flight delay prediction. It unfolds in two pivotal stages: Classification and Regression. In the initial classification stage, we leverage a suite of classification algorithms to categorize flights into two distinct classes, namely ’Delayed’ or ’Not Delayed’. These classifiers are meticulously evaluated using performance metrics to ensure their accuracy and effectiveness. In the subsequent regression stage, regression algorithms are utilised in generating highly accurate forecasts for arrival delays, quantified in minutes. The evaluation of regressors was performed, involving an in-depth analysis of metrics to identify the top-performing model. Through this rigorous comparison of various models, we identify and select the best performing classifier and regressor models based on their ability to meet the accuracy and precision criteria.
